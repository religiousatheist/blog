Hi!I'm Ashutosh and i just wanted to make a blog so i did it and i'm proud of myself for making it. 
I knew what i wanted my blog to be about,God. I'm quite intrigued by the concept of God which at first makes sense
when you're a kid,then you grow and it doesn't make sense,and then you grow further and have a sligt idea why this
concept is needed in this world.
In future,it won't always be about god,will be different topics. I've thought about them just have not written them 
yet.
If you have an article/paragraph you want to post,contact me and i'll add that article to this blog.
Sayonara(^-^).
